CRUD - React, NodeJS and SQLite3


Hey guys! Welcome to my channel. Today I bring you another incredible project that you can add to your GitHub.

In this video, I will show a CRUD project developed with React, Node.js and SQLite3. The goal is to create a simple but highly functional system for managing product information.

In the project, you will learn how to create a friendly and responsive interface using React. With it, you can add products by entering the name, supplier ID, category ID, corresponding unit and price. This information will be stored locally on our server.

Additionally, you will see how to implement the automatic product list update functionality. Whenever a new product is added, the list will be updated instantly.

So, without further ado, let's dive into this journey of creating a CRUD with React, Node.js and SQLite3 for product management. I hope you like it and that this project is useful to you. Don't forget to leave your comments and suggestions below.

If you liked the project, I ask you to subscribe and like.
