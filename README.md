# CRUD-Fullstack

CRUD - React, NodeJS and SQLite3

This is about a CRUD project developed with React, Node.js and SQLite3. The goal is to create a simple but highly functional system for managing product information.

In the project, you will learn how to create a friendly and responsive interface using React. With it, you can add products by entering the name, supplier ID, category ID, corresponding unit and price. This information will be stored locally on our server.

Additionally, you will see how to implement the automatic product list update functionality. Whenever a new product is added, the list will be updated instantly.

In the terminal of project root path, type `npm run dev`.
